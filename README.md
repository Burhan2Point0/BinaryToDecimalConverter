# BinaryToDecimalConverter
This is a Java program that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a binary to decimal converter. The GUI has a text field for entering a binary number, a button for triggering the conversion, and a label for displaying the result. 

When the user clicks the "Convert" button or presses the Enter key in the binary field, the program attempts to parse the binary number and convert it to a decimal number. If the binary number is invalid, the program displays an error message on the label. Otherwise, it displays the binary number and its decimal equivalent. 

The program defines a BinaryToDecimalConverter class that implements the ActionListener interface. The actionPerformed method is called when the user interacts with the GUI components, and it handles the logic for converting the binary number to decimal and updating the result label. 

The program creates an instance of the BinaryToDecimalConverter class in the main method, which creates and displays the GUI window.
